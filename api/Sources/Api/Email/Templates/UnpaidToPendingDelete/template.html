<p>Gertrude parent account holder,</p>

<p>
  This is Jared from Gertrude, writing to let you know that because your account has been
  in an unpaid status for 1 year, we have scheduled to delete it in 30 days. If you'd like
  to resume using Gertrude, you may login to the
  <a href="https://parents.gertrude.app/settings">parents website</a> and click the
  <b>Start/Manage subscription</b> button in order to setup a payment, at which point your
  account will be restored and you may use Gertrude to protect your children again.
</p>

<p>
  If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to reach out. If you reply to
  this email, it will come straight to me.
</p>

<p>- Jared</p>
