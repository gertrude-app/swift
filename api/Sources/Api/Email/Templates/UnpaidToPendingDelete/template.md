Gertrude parent account holder,

This is Jared from Gertrude, writing to let you know that because your account has been in
an unpaid status for 1 year, we have scheduled to delete it in 30 days. If you'd like to
resume using Gertrude, you may login to the parents website here:

https://parents.gertrude.app/settings

And click the "Start/Manage subscription" button in order to setup a payment, at which
point your account will be restored and you may use Gertrude to protect your children
again.

If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to reach out. If you reply to this
email, it will come straight to me.

- Jared
