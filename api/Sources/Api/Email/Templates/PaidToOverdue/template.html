<p>Gertrude parent account holder,</p>

<p>
  This is Jared from Gertrude, writing to let you know that we did not receive payment for
  your Gertrude account this month, and it is now considered <b>overdue.</b>
  This can happen for a number of reasons, but the most common is that your credit card
  expired, or your bank declined the charge for some reason. To resolve the issue and
  guarantee uninterrupted protection of your children, please login to the
  <a href="https://parents.gertrude.app/settings">parents website</a> and click the
  <b>Manage subscription</b> button, then resolve the payment issue from there.
</p>

<p>
  If we don't receive a payment <em>within 2 weeks,</em> any Gertrude Mac apps connected
  to your account will <b>lose some functionality.</b> They will continue blocking the
  internet according to the rules already in place, but no rules can be created or edited
  after that point, all screenshots and keylogging will cease, and the app will no longer
  be able to issue or respond to unlock requests or filter suspension requests. Basically,
  we turn off all of the features that actively cost us money, until your subscription is
  paid.
</p>

<p>
  If you're having any kind of trouble with Gertrude, or have any questions at all, please
  don't hesitate to reach out. If you reply to this email, it will come straight to me.
</p>

<p>- Jared</p>
