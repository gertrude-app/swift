<h1>Gertrude 2.5.0 Released!</h1>
<p class="subheading" style="line-height: 1.45em">
  Today we're releasing <strong>version 2.5.0</strong>, a big update to the
  Gertrude macOS app, with some of your top-requested features, including
  <em>scheduled keychains</em> and <em>downtime</em>. Plus, we've released the
  first version of a
  <a
    href="https://gertrude.app/blog/how-parents-can-block-images-gif-search-ios-18"
    >Gertrude iOS app,</a
  >
  focused on plugging holes in Apple's Screen Time features.
</p>
<section class="feature">
  <h2>Scheduled keychains</h2>
  <p>
    If you've ever wanted to allow your kids access to a site or app, but only
    at certain times, you can now do that with a new feature landing in Gertrude
    2.5.0—<strong>Scheduled Keychains</strong>. Scheduled keychains are great
    for things like games or entertainment-focused apps and sites that you're OK
    with your child using, but <em>not all the time.</em> For instance, if you
    have a keychain for Minecraft, you can assign it to only be active after
    3pm, or on weekends. To add a schedule to a keychain, go to the "Settings"
    screen for your child, scroll down to the assigned keychains area, and click
    "Add Schedule".

  <h2>Downtime</h2>
  <p>
    Gertrude 2.5.0 brings another time-based feature for extra safety and peace
    of mind:
    <strong>Downtime</strong>. Downtime allows you to pick a daily time window
    during which your child will have no access whatsoever to the internet. The
    most common use case for this is disabling internet access
    <strong>overnight,</strong> when your child should be sleeping or away from
    screens.
  </p>
  <p>
    To enable Downtime, go to the "Settings" screen for your child, and toggle
    the Downtime option, then select a time. When your child's Mac is about to
    go into downtime, they'll get a notification. Parent's can pause downtime
    from the Gertrude menu bar dropdown with their admin password.
  </p>

  <h2>Security Events</h2>
  <p>
    Another new feature that landed recently is something we call “Security
    Events.” The Gertrude macOS app and the parents website now record
    noteworthy events like logins, filter suspensions, changes in protection
    settings, and more. You can view a feed of recent security events from the
    parents website in the new
    <a href="https://parents.gertrude.app/security-events">Security</a> tab.
    This area is especially useful if you have a highly tech-savvy child that
    you're worried might try to circumvent Gertrude in any way, or if you have a
    loved one you're protecting who is an adult with admin privileges on their
    computer.

  <h2>Gertrude Blocker iOS App</h2>
  <p>
    When iOS 18 was released this fall, we were
    <a
      href="https://gertrude.app/blog/ios18-screentime-what-parents-should-know"
      >dissapointed to find</a
    >
    that Apple had not fixed a
    <a href="https://gertrude.app/blog/ios-17-cant-delete-messages-images"
      >glaring loophole in Screen Time</a
    >
    introduced a year earlier in iOS 17—the inability for parents to block
    <em>searching for animated GIFs</em> in the Apple texting app Messages.
    Also, several new loopholes introduced that made iOS 18 even less safe for
    kids.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because of these issues, we created and released a simple iOS called
    <strong>Gertrude Blocker</strong> that patches these loopholes in Screen
    Time. Due to restrictions imposed by Apple, it only works for devices owned
    by children under 18 with Apple Family Sharing turned on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Right now the Gertrude iOS app doesn't have any direct integration with your
    Gertrude account, but we're exploring making the app more configurable and
    allowing it to be connected to and controlled by a parent from the Gertrude
    parents site. For more details,

    or
    <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gertrude-blocker/id6736368820"
      >view it in the app store here</a
    >. We'd love to hear what you think if you try the app out!
