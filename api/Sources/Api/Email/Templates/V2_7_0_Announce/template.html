  <h2>Blocking Mac Apps</h2>
  <p>
    As an additional layer of safety and control for parents, Gertrude
    <code>v2.7.0</code> now allows you to
    <a href="https://gertrude.app/docs/block-mac-apps">block any macOS app</a
    >&mdash;either on a schedule, or all the time.
  </p>
  <p>
    To access this new feature, make sure your child's Mac has the latest version of
    Gertrude, then navigate to their
    <a href="https://parents.gertrude.app/children">Settings</a> screen, and scroll down
    to the area labeled <b>Blocked apps</b>. From there, you can type the name of an app
    you want to block, and optionally configure it to only block on a schedule.

  <h2>New Monitoring Safeguard</h2>
  <p>
    It was recently brought to our attention that it was possible for very tech-savvy
    child to take a specific sequence of steps that would result in part of the Gertrude
    app no longer running. While we don't know that any child has ever exploited this
    exact sequence, and even if they did it could not disable the internet filter, we
    still felt it was important to address, because it could theoretically cause parents
    to temporarily lose screenshot and keystroke monitoring.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the new version of Gertrude filter detects that this part is no longer running, the
    filter will start blocking all internet access for the unmonitored user. This means
    that any child who attempts this workaround will effectively cut off their internet
    access until the app is completely running again, hopefully mitigating any danger.
  </p>

  <h2>macOS Sequoia Updates</h2>
  <p>
    Gertrude 2.7.0 also includes an update that is necessary to workaround changes in
    privacy system settings in macOS Sequoia. Apple has recently shipped some changes
    aimed at making it harder for malicious software to record your screen without your
    knowledge. Gertrude's screenshot monitoring feature only works after an admin grants
    permission, and always displays to your child when their screen is being recorded.
    Despite this, the newest versions of Sequoia have started producing misleading
    warnings about Gertrude accessing the screen. In some cases, these warnings could show
    up hundreds of times a day, and could even reveal to your children the approximate
    cadence and frequency of the screenshots.
  </p>
  <p>
    The new version is able to suppress these spurious warnings, but requires a new
    permission in order to do so. You'll notice when you upgrade that Gertrude will open a
    large window explaining the new permission and showing you how to grant it.
  </p>

  <h2>New Keychain Warnings</h2>
  <p>
    Some of our public keychains have areas of known risk that cannot be avoided, but
    still make sense for certain users. For instance, the keychain for
    <b>Google Docs</b> makes it possible for a child to search for and insert images, some
    of which are moderately inappropriate. To make sure that parents are aware of the
    risks, we've surfaced a new warning for any keychains that we believe are not
    appropriate for all children.
  </p>

<section class="feature">
  <h2>Detailed Filter Status</h2>
  <p>
    The new version of the Gertrude app sends back more detailed information about it's
    current filter status, including when it's suspended and when it will resume,
    downtime, and more. This information will be showing up soon in the parent's website,
    helping you see at a glance with even more clarity exactly what's going on with all
    your kids' computers.

  <h2>iOS App Updates Coming Soon...</h2>
  <p>
    We also have some exciting updates in the works for our
    <a href="https://gertrude.app/blog/how-parents-can-block-images-gif-search-ios-18"
      >Gertrude iOS app,</a
    >
    which we released a few months ago, including the ability to control new areas of
    content blocking, a built-in ability to clear the cache from previously viewed GIFs,
    and a much-improved onboarding and installation flow.
  </p>
  <p>
    We think these changes will pave the way towards eventually making the iOS app
    configurable and controllable from your parents account, giving you the flexibility
    and control you love about Gertrude for Mac, but on their iPhone or iPad. Stay tuned!
