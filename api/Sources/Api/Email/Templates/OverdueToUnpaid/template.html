<p>Gertrude parent account holder,</p>

<br />

<p>
  This is Jared from Gertrude, writing to let you know that because your
  Gertrude trial period ended, and we did not receive any payment within 2
  weeks, your account has been disabled. If you'd like to continue using
  Gertrude, please login to the
  <a href="https://parents.gertrude.app/settings">parents website</a> and click
  the <b>Start/Manage subscription</b> button.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  Any Gertrude Mac apps connected to your account have
  <b>lost some functionality.</b>
  They will continue blocking the internet according to the rules already in
  place, but no rules can be created or edited after that point, all screenshots
  and keylogging have ceased, and the app will no longer be able to issue or
  respond to unlock requests or filter suspension requests. Basically, we
  disable all of the features that actively cost us money, until your
  subscription is paid.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to reach out. If you
  reply to this email, it will come straight to me.
</p>

<br />
