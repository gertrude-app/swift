Gertrude parent account holder,

This is Jared from Gertrude, writing to let you know that because your Gertrude trial
period ended, and we did not receive any payment within 2 weeks, your account has been
disabled. If you'd like to continue using Gertrude, please login to the parents website
here:

https://parents.gertrude.app/settings

And then click the "Start/Manage subscription" button.

Any Gertrude Mac apps connected to your account have lost SOME functionality. They will
continue blocking the internet according to the rules already in place, but no rules can
be created or edited after that point, all screenshots and keylogging have ceased, and the
app will no longer be able to issue or respond to unlock requests or filter suspension
requests. Basically, we disable all of the features that actively cost us money, until
your subscription is paid.

If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to reach out. If you reply to this
email, it will come straight to me.

- Jared
