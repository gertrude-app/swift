Gertrude parent account holder,

This is Jared from Gertrude, writing to let you know that your {{length}} day free trial
has ended. If you'd like to continue using Gertrude, please login to the parents website
here:

https://parents.gertrude.app/settings

And then click the "Start subscription" button.

If you don't setup up payment within 7 days, any Gertrude Mac apps connected to your
account will lose SOME functionality. They will continue blocking the internet according
to the rules already in place, but no rules can be created or edited after that point, all
screenshots and keylogging will cease, and the app will no longer be able to issue or
respond to unlock requests or filter suspension requests. Basically, we turn off all of
the features that actively cost us money, until your subscription is paid.

If you're having any kind of trouble with Gertrude, or have any questions at all, please
don't hesitate to reach out. If you reply to this email, it will come straight to me.

- Jared
