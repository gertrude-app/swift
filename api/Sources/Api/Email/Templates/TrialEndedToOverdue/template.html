<p>Gertrude parent account holder,</p>

<br />

<p>
  This is Jared from Gertrude, writing to let you know that your 60 day free
  trial
  <em>has ended.</em> If you'd like to continue using Gertrude, please login to
  the <a href="https://parents.gertrude.app/settings">parents website</a> and
  click the <b>Start subscription</b> button.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  If you don't setup up payment <em>within 2 weeks,</em> any Gertrude Mac apps
  connected to your account will <b>lose some functionality.</b> They will
  continue blocking the internet according to the rules already in place, but no
  rules can be created or edited after that point, all screenshots and
  keylogging will cease, and the app will no longer be able to issue or respond
  to unlock requests or filter suspension requests. Basically, we turn off all
  of the features that actively cost us money, until your subscription is paid.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  If you're having any kind of trouble with Gertrude, or have any questions at
  all, please don't hesitate to reach out. If you reply to this email, it will
  come straight to me.
</p>

<br />
