# Duet

A hand-rolled, bare-bones Swift Postgres database layer ORM type thingy, an alternative to
Vapor Fluent.

Probably no one but me should ever use this in production, it's highly tuned to work for
exactly my use cases and not really able to function as a general purpose tool. But that
said, it is pretty rad.
